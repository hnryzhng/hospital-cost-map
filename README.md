Since high opaque healthcare costs continue to be a problem for many Americans, I created an interactive map using open federal government data so users can get an idea of the costs of particular surgeries or other treatments corresponding to specific diagnoses. 

## Disclaimer ## 
Please note that the app is for information purposes only. For accurate information pertaining to your health, please consult your doctor, insurance company, or relevant healthcare institutions. 

## Data sources ## 
Inpatient data with treatment costs at particular hospitals were obtained from the website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It comprises aggregated costs from the claimants of the government healthcare programs.  

The diagnostic codes and associated diseases/health problems are from ICD-10, the international standard for classification of diseases and health conditions. 

## Tools ##
The backend runs on Node.js. 

The map is rendered using the Google Maps Javascript API.

The app was deployed using Heroku.
