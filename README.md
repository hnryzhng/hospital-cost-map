Since high opaque healthcare costs continue to be a problem for Americans, I created an interactive map using open federal government data for users to find costs of particular surgeries or other treatments based on their diagnoses. 

## Disclaimer ## 

Please note that the app is purely for reference. For accurate information pertaining to your health condition, please consult your doctor, insurance company, and healthcare institutions. 

## Data sources ## 
Inpatient data with treatment costs at particular hospitals were obtained from the website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It comprises aggregated costs from the claimants of the government healthcare programs.  

The diagnostic codes and associated diseases/health problems were taken from ICD-10. 

## Tools ##
The backend runs on Node.js. 

The map is rendered using the Google Maps Javascript API.

The app is deployed using Heroku.
